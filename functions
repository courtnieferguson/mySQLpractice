The Math.ceil() function is used to get the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number.

The Math.random() function is used to get a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range [0, 1] that is,
from 0 (inclusive) up to but not including 1 (exclusive), which you can then scale to your desired range.
